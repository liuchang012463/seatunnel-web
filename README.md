## Overview

**SeaTunnel Web** is an independent third-party Web UI built for **Apache SeaTunnel**.

It provides a visual and practical way to create, configure, run, schedule, and monitor data synchronization jobs without manually maintaining complex SeaTunnel configuration files.

With SeaTunnel Web, users can manage data sources, build batch and streaming pipelines, configure field mappings, generate SeaTunnel job configurations, submit jobs to the SeaTunnel engine, inspect runtime logs, and monitor execution metrics from a unified Web interface.

> Our goal is simple: make Apache SeaTunnel easier to use in real-world data integration scenarios.

## Highlights

### Visual Pipeline Builder

Build data synchronization pipelines with a drag-and-drop DAG editor.

Configure Source, Transform, and Sink nodes visually, making complex synchronization workflows easier to understand and maintain.

### Batch and Streaming Jobs

Create and manage both batch and real-time data synchronization tasks through a unified interface.

SeaTunnel Web supports multiple task creation modes, including visual guidance and script-based configuration.

### Data Source Management

Manage commonly used data sources from one place, including:

* MySQL
* MySQL CDC
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Other supported JDBC-compatible data sources

Users can configure connections, test connectivity, inspect metadata, and reuse data sources across different jobs.

### Field Mapping and Data Transformation

Configure source-to-target field mappings visually.

SeaTunnel Web also supports SQL-based transformations and automatically generates the corresponding SeaTunnel job configuration.

### Job Lifecycle Management

Manage the complete lifecycle of a SeaTunnel job:

* Create and edit jobs
* Publish job definitions
* Submit jobs
* Stop running jobs
* View execution history
* Inspect runtime logs
* Track job status
* Manage scheduled execution

### Runtime Metrics

View key runtime metrics directly from the Web UI, including:

* Read rows
* Written rows
* Read QPS
* Write QPS
* Data volume
* Job status
* Task execution progress

The built-in metrics view helps users understand job execution without requiring an additional monitoring platform for basic troubleshooting.

### Automatic Configuration Generation

SeaTunnel Web converts visual job definitions into executable SeaTunnel configuration files.

This reduces repetitive configuration work and helps teams standardize data synchronization development.

## Why SeaTunnel Web?

Apache SeaTunnel provides powerful data integration capabilities, but manually writing and maintaining configuration files can still be challenging in large-scale or multi-team environments.

SeaTunnel Web is designed for teams that need:

* A visual Web UI for Apache SeaTunnel
* Standardized data source management
* Low-code pipeline configuration
* Reusable synchronization workflows
* Batch and real-time job management
* Task scheduling and execution history
* Runtime logs and metrics
* Lower configuration and maintenance costs
* A smoother onboarding experience for new users

## Compatibility

The following environment is supported or recommended for the current version:

| Component        | Supported or Recommended Version |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |

> SeaTunnel Web currently performs version validation when connecting to the SeaTunnel engine. Please use a supported SeaTunnel version.

## Architecture

SeaTunnel Web uses a front-end and back-end separated architecture.

For containerized deployment, Nginx serves the front-end assets and proxies API and WebSocket traffic to the Spring Boot service. The Spring Boot service connects to the SeaTunnel Web metadata database and communicates with the configured Apache SeaTunnel engine.

## Quick Start

Docker Compose is the recommended way to run SeaTunnel Web locally.

For complete installation and deployment instructions, please refer to the project documentation:

**Documentation:**  
https://doc.seatunnel-web.com/

### Option A: Docker Compose with MySQL

This mode starts the following services together:

* MySQL 8.0
* SeaTunnel Web API
* Nginx front end

Clone the repository and create the environment file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weifuwan/seatunnel-web.git
cd seatunnel-web
cp .env.example .env
```

Build and start the services:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open SeaTunnel Web:

```text
http://localhost:9527
```

View the service status and logs:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f seatunnel-web-api
```

Stop the services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To recreate the local MySQL database and run the initialization scripts again:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --build
```

> `docker compose down -v` permanently removes the Compose-managed MySQL data volume.

### Option B: Docker Compose with an Existing MySQL

Use this mode when MySQL is already installed on the host or deployed on another server.

Create the external database and execute the MySQL initialization SQL before starting SeaTunnel Web. The SQL files are included in the distribution package under `sql/` and are also available in the source repository under:

```text
seatunnel-web-api/src/main/resources/sql/
```

Create the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.without-mysql.example .env.without-mysql
```

Configure the existing database:

```env
MYSQL_HOST=host.docker.internal
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DATABASE=seatunnel_web
MYSQL_USER=seatunnel
MYSQL_PASSWORD=change_me
```

On Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS, use:

```env
MYSQL_HOST=host.docker.internal
```

For a remote MySQL server, set `MYSQL_HOST` to its hostname or IP address.

The MySQL account must allow connections from the Docker host. A dedicated account is recommended:

```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'seatunnel'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'change_me';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON seatunnel_web.* TO 'seatunnel'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Start SeaTunnel Web without starting another MySQL container:

```bash
docker compose   --env-file .env.without-mysql   -f compose.without-mysql.yaml   up -d --build
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose   --env-file .env.without-mysql   -f compose.without-mysql.yaml   logs -f seatunnel-web-api
```

### Option C: Build the Distribution Package from Source

Requirements:

* JDK 21
* Node.js 20 or later
* Yarn Classic
* MySQL 8.0
* Maven, or the Maven Wrapper included in the repository

Build the front-end assets first:

```bash
cd seatunnel-web-ui
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn build
cd ..
```

Build the complete distribution package from the repository root:

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

On Windows:

```cmd
mvnw.cmd clean package -DskipTests
```

The generated package is located under:

```text
seatunnel-web-dist/target/
```

The distribution package contains:

```text
seatunnel-web-<version>/
├── bin/
│   ├── run-seatunnel-web.sh
│   ├── start-seatunnel-web.sh
│   ├── status-seatunnel-web.sh
│   └── stop-seatunnel-web.sh
├── conf/
│   ├── application.yml
│   ├── logback-spring.xml
│   └── nginx/
│       └── default.conf
├── jdbc-drivers/
├── libs/
│   └── seatunnel-web-api.jar
├── sql/
├── web/
├── LICENSE
├── NOTICE
└── README.md
```

The same distribution package is used to produce both runtime images:

* `seatunnel-web-api`: Java 21 back-end runtime
* `seatunnel-web`: Nginx front end and reverse proxy

For a manual Linux deployment, extract the package, review `conf/application.yml`, start the back end with the scripts under `bin/`, and configure Nginx with `conf/nginx/default.conf`.

### Option D: Offline / Bind-Mount Deployment (Docker Compose v3.6)

Use this mode when the deployment environment has limited or no access to a Docker registry
and you want to avoid rebuilding the front-end and back-end images on every release.
This mode reuses the official `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-jammy` and `nginx:latest` base images
and bind-mounts the distribution package produced in Option C directly into the containers.

> Both base images only need to be pulled or `docker load`-ed once per environment.
> Subsequent upgrades only require replacing the contents of `./dist`.

#### Build and extract the distribution package

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

mkdir -p dist
tar -xzf seatunnel-web-dist/target/seatunnel-web-*.tar.gz -C dist/
```

After extraction, the package layout is:

```text
dist/
└── seatunnel-web-1.0.0/
    ├── bin/
    ├── conf/
    ├── jdbc-drivers/
    ├── libs/seatunnel-web-api.jar
    ├── sql/
    └── web/
```

If the `bin/*.sh` scripts lose their executable bit during transfer (for example,
extracting on Windows and then copying to Linux), run:

```bash
chmod +x dist/seatunnel-web-1.0.0/bin/*.sh
```

#### Variant D-1: With a bundled MySQL container

Create the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.bind.example .env.bind
```

Start the services:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.bind -f compose.bind.yaml up -d
```

Open SeaTunnel Web:

```text
http://localhost:9527
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.bind -f compose.bind.yaml logs -f seatunnel-web-api
```

#### Variant D-2: With an existing external MySQL

Create the external database and execute the MySQL initialization SQL from
`seatunnel-web-api/src/main/resources/sql/` (also bundled under `dist/seatunnel-web-1.0.0/sql/`)
before starting SeaTunnel Web.

Create the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.without-mysql.bind.example .env.without-mysql.bind
```

Configure the existing database in `.env.without-mysql.bind`:

```env
MYSQL_HOST=host.docker.internal
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DATABASE=seatunnel_web
MYSQL_USER=seatunnel
MYSQL_PASSWORD=change_me
```

On Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS, use:

```env
MYSQL_HOST=host.docker.internal
```

For a remote MySQL server, set `MYSQL_HOST` to its hostname or IP address.
The MySQL account must allow connections from the Docker host.

Start the services:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file .env.without-mysql.bind \
  -f compose.bind.without-mysql.yaml \
  up -d
```

Open SeaTunnel Web:

```text
http://localhost:9001
```

#### Upgrade flow (Variant D-1 or D-2)

Bind-mount deployment upgrades only require replacing the contents of `./dist`:

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
rm -rf dist/*
tar -xzf seatunnel-web-dist/target/seatunnel-web-*.tar.gz -C dist/

docker compose --env-file .env.bind -f compose.bind.yaml up -d
```

No image rebuild is required. Re-running `up -d` recreates the affected
containers while preserving the named volumes (`seatunnel-web-logs`,
`seatunnel-web-jdbc-drivers`, and `seatunnel-web-mysql-data` when bundled).

#### Notes on the bind-mount variant

* The compose files declare `version: '3.6'` and use the official
  `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-jammy` and `nginx:latest` images directly; no
  `build:` section is involved.
* The back-end container overrides its entrypoint to
  `/opt/seatunnel-web/bin/run-seatunnel-web.sh` from the bind-mounted
  distribution package.
* The front-end container mounts `dist/seatunnel-web-1.0.0/web` to
  `/usr/share/nginx/html` (read-only) and the project's
  `conf/nginx/default.conf` to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` (read-only).
* Logs and JDBC drivers use named volumes so container writes do not pollute
  the bind-mounted host directory.
* `dist/seatunnel-web-1.0.0/conf/application.yml` is intentionally not
  read-only-mounted. This allows on-site tuning during development and
  iteration. Production releases should treat the YAML as part of the
  release artifact.

### Connect to Apache SeaTunnel

After SeaTunnel Web starts:

1. Open the SeaTunnel client management page.
2. Add an Apache SeaTunnel 2.3.13 engine address.
3. Test the connection.
4. Create a data source.
5. Create and publish a synchronization job.
6. Submit the job and inspect runtime logs and metrics.

## Development

### Back-End Development

Requirements:

* JDK 21
* Maven 3.8 or later
* MySQL 8.0

Start the back end:

```bash
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
./mvnw -pl seatunnel-web-api spring-boot:run
```

The default back-end port is:

```text
9527
```

### Front-End Development

Enter the front-end directory:

```bash
cd seatunnel-web-ui
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Build the production assets:

```bash
